 and a separate collaboration with Steffen Schumann and my supervisor Luigi Del Debbio. Unless explicitly stated, the results presented in this thesis are either mine,

  \chapter*{Acknowledgements}
  \begin{spacing}{1.5}
After almost four years of studying in Edinburgh I find that there are many people I would like to thank for 
making my time here so memorable. First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor Luigi Del Debbio
for his advice and expertise, along with his encouragement and interest in my progress as physicist. I wouldn't
have made it this far without his guidance and direction.

For providing such a great environment in which to learn, I'd like to thank the staff of the Edinburgh PPT group.
Particular thanks go to Richard Ball, Arjun Berera, Einan Gardi, and Brian Pendleton for their consistently useful advice, for which I am greatly
appreciative. Special thanks go to my fellow students, without whom the experience wouldn't have been anywhere near as interesting.
I'd particularly like to thank the students of the 2010 contingent, Ashley Cooke, Tom Metcalf and Samuel Abreu for their
companionship and humour. Outside of the Edinburgh physics group, I'd like to thank Xin He and James Kelly for many long
and interesting discussions.

During my PhD I've had the pleasure of working within the NNPDF collaboration. From the collaboration I have received
an incredible amount of support, learnt a great deal, and made many good friends. Special thanks go to Chris Deans who shared
the experience with me as an NNPDF student in Edinburgh.

During my third year, Steffen Schumann provided me with the opportunity to work and study at the University
of G\"ottingen, where I gained valuable experience outside the main topic of my PhD. I'm very grateful for the opportunity, and I'd like to thank
Steffen, along with Erik Gerwick, for making the visit such a welcoming and enjoyable experience. 

For providing me with the chance to study at Edinburgh and G\"ottingen, thanks go to the STFC and the MCnet initial training network for their
financial support.

Finally, thanks go to my girlfriend Sophie, and my family, particularly my parents who have supported me throughout my life and studies so far. This thesis is dedicated to them.
